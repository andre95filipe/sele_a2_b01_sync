# Electronic Systems - Sistemas Eletr√≥nicos


## Synchronous communication system 

### Description

* This system is composed of an arduino connected to a sonar, SRF08, supporting I2C and to a display PCD8544 support SPI.
* The I2Clib lib supports starting and stopping transmissions when the arduino is acting as a Master receiver or transmitter using the Two Wire Interface available on the ATmega328 microcontroller.
    * Writing and reading the Two Wire Interface data register is done through the Two Wire Interface interrupt service routine. 
* The i2csonar lib supports initiating reads on sonar, setting sonar range and gain, choosing sonar output between centimeters, microseconds and inches, and reading the sonar distance readings on first register.

* The spi lib supports the use of the SPI port that Arduino offers. This driver only supports only master mode, since it was the mode used in this project.
* The PCD8544 is a 84x48 pixels LCD that supports spi interface. It is used the developed spi library to control this LCD.
